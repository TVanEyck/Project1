      "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "There were a couple of problems with this data.\n",
      "One, the data only included data from years 1960 to 1980, so we couldn't make conclusions with contemporary data.\n",
      "Two, in order to be able to do the things we wanted with the data, it would require transposing the rows and columns, which we weren't sure how to do, given the layout of the file.\n",
      "Three, the merging created file sizes so large that it made it all but impossible to Git Push.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "For this reason, we pulled data from the World Bank website, which contains economic indicator data from years 1960 to 2019 for analysis.\n",
      "This enabled us to work with the range of years we wanted and made merging far simpler, since we could merge everything by the CountryCode column.\n",
      "Because we had all of the data we needed, we didn't need to pull data from any API.\n",
      "We ended up chosing to look at: GDP per Capita, Life Expectancy, Infant Mortality, Exports, & Imports.\n",
      "We started by attempting to look at the relationship between GDP per Capita and the remaining indicators.\n",

      "Every file had Country Code in common, so we decided to merge each file by that column.\n",
      "We discovered that x & y are the only suffices that get added, so if three or more columns have the same name, there will nothing to differentiate them.\n",
      "To get around this, we decided to use the Add_Suffix function to our dataframes to add the corresponding type of indictor name to the end of each column.\n",
      "In order to be able to merge by the CountryCode column, we had to change the column name for that column to drop the suffix.\n",
      "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "Since every indicator type had the exact same rows and columns (not counting values), we simply had to merge by CountryCode and essentially append columns from one file to to end of the columns from another.\n",

      "We then took the average yearly values across all countries and plot across all years.\n",

      "To do those, we had to define a function and then use curve_fit instead of linregress.\n",
